## Something about me 👀:
- I'm a **computer science** student and I'm currently studying at Universidad de Ingeniería y Tecnología in Peru.
- The languages that i currently manage are **c++**, **python**, **HTML** and **CSS**. Although my level in those languages aren't as higer as is expected I'm working hard to improve in those
## Fun fact ⚡:
- My tongue language is spanish, however, I'm writing this on english because i want to do more understandable my profile for as many people as possible.
